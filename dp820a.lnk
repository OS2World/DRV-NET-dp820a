=================================================================
National Semiconductor DP83820 Another NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver 1.09
=================================================================

1.Introduction

I have published previously a DP83820 driver based on NSC code.
Though NSC does not mention anything to use secondarily the code, 
I think that NSC has still the implicit copyright to the secondary 
code modified by me. 
I wrote another driver at my own code to avoid such indefinite status.

Included files are:
dp820a.os2	NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver
dp820a.nif	Network Information File
dp820a.sym	Symbol Map file
dp820a.lnk	Document (this file)
source.zip	source files

You could download the latest file on the gomi:NDIS MAC Drivers page,

2.No Warranty

This code is provided 'AS IS' and any warranties are disclaimed.


3.Functional restrictions

- PHY address is assumed as 1. The other addresses are not supported.
- VLAN functions are not supported.
- Priority queue functions are not supported.
- TBI is not supported. (MII or GMII)


4.Considerable Configuration Keywords

- NSC says that TXEARLY(TxDrth), TXFLTH and TXMXDMA restrict each other. 
    FIFOsize(8KB) - TXEARLY >= TXFLTH > TXMXDMA
  Be careful if you want to modify these parameters.

- Set RXAIRL=YES, if you want to use the netbios(NETBEUI) protocol.
  Tcp/ip and/or netbios over tcp/ip are not subject to this parameter.


5.Note

//- Maximum Frame Size modification is not tested.
- No test on SMP environment. (I gess it can work.)


6.Redistribution with modification

Your should add your copyright notice, 
"(c)Copyright 2005 your name. All rights reserved."
and remove mine (if it exists),
"(c)Copyright 2005 chagrin. Some rights reserved."

This means that the modified binary/source is not mine, but yours, 
regardless of the degree of the modification. 
You can redistribute, of course, that for the commercial purpose 
without any fee to me, without releasing the source, if you want.

Don't forget that I'm never liable for your product.
(You, also, should add a disclaimer.)
